The convolution function in AZURE2 is at the end of the file called TargetEffects.cpp. To generalize this, we'll also have to come up with a way to distinguish through the GUI whether we want to apply an energy dependant or independant convolution function. There is a way to enter a custom function to define the stopping power as a function of energy. We may be able to steal this part of the code and adapt it here so that a user can define any kind of arbitrary resolution function that they wish. That would be a pretty nice feature.
